# Malicious URL Detection

This repository contains a simple machine learning project focused on **detecting malicious / phishing URLs** using a labeled dataset.

It is intended for **educational and research purposes**, not for active exploitation or real-world attack deployment.

## 📂 Repository Contents

- **`malicious_phish.csv.zip`**  
  A compressed dataset containing URLs labeled as malicious or benign.  
  Typical use cases include phishing detection, URL classification, and security research.

- **`ml.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter Notebook that:
  - Loads and preprocesses the dataset  
  - Extracts features from URLs  
  - Trains and evaluates a machine learning model

## 🧠 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to explore how machine learning techniques can be used to:

- Identify malicious or phishing URLs  
- Understand patterns in harmful web links  
- Experiment with basic cybersecurity-focused ML workflows  

This project does **not** generate malware or perform attacks.
